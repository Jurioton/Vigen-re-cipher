# Vigen-re-cipher
This project is an implementation of the Vigen√®re Cipher, a classic method of encryption that uses a keyword to encode and decode messages. It extends the Caesar Cipher by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword, making it more secure against frequency analysis.
